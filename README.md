This is palindrome algorihtm which reads the same backward as forward such as savas, madam, kazak... 
There are many different solutions in this problem. This is my solution. 
The project contains Main.class, Palindrome.class, PalindromeFactory.class and PalindromeFactoryTest.class. 

You can run Main and PalindromeFactoryTest classes.
This project finds 3 (or any given number) longest unique palindromes.

*findPalindromes() -> method is in the PalindromeFactory class that can find all unique palindromes according to given string.
*getPalindromes() -> method is in the Main class than can find the longest palindromes according to given string and limit.
